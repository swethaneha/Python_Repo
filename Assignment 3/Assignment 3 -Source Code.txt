Assignment3 :

Task 1:
1.1 Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.

try :
    num=int(input('Enter a number'))
    if num==0:
        raise ValueError ('Can not divide by 0')
    else:
        print('Result: ',5/num)
except Exception as e:
    print('Error :',e)
else:
    print('Successfully Computed the result')


1.2 Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["Americans",
"Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in ["Baseball","cricket"].

subjects=["Americans ","Indians"]
verbs=["play","watch"]
objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]
l1=list(i+' '+j+' '+k for i in subjects for j in verbs for k in objects)
print(*l1,sep='\n')


1.3 Write a function so that the columns of the output matrix are powers of the input vector.  
The order of the powers is determined by the increasing boolean argument. Specifically, when increasing is False, 
the i-th output column is the input vector raised element-wise to the power of N - i - 1

import numpy as ny
arr=ny.array([1,2,3,4,5])
N=4
print(ny.vander(arr,N))
